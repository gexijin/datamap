## DataMap: Visualizing Data Matrices in Your Browser

To use this app, just visit this [static GitHub page.](https://gexijin.github.io/datamap/) For large datasets, install it as an R package for local execution: 
```{R}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("gexijin/datamap", ref = "rPackage", upgrade = "never")
DataMap::run_datamap()
```

DataMap is a secure, browser-based application for visualizing high-dimensional 'omics and other data matrices with heatmaps, PCA, and t-SNE. Built with Shiny and running entirely in your browser through Shinylive technology, DataMap ensures your data never leaves your device.
