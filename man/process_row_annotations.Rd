\arguments{
\item{main_data_rows}{A vector of row identifiers from the main data set.}

\item{file_annotation_df}{An optional data frame containing row annotations from an uploaded file.
Default is NULL.}

\item{factor_annotation_df}{An optional data frame containing row annotations based on factors.
Default is NULL.}

\item{selected_annotations}{A character vector specifying the names of annotations to extract.}

\description{
This function processes and combines annotation data for rows from two potential sources:
a file-uploaded annotation data frame and an auto-detected factor annotation data frame. It selects
desired annotation columns based on the provided list, aligns these annotations with the main data rows,
and merges them into a single data frame.
